                    <p class="card-text">Keanu Reeves (born September 2, 1964, Beirut, Lebanon) Canadian actor who found his greatest success in comedy, science-fiction, and action movies.
                    Reeves’s mother was an English performer and costume designer, and his father was a Hawaiian geologist. They divorced when he was a young child, and he lived with his mother. The family moved first to Sydney, then to New York City, and finally to Toronto, where Reeves grew up. He struggled in school and attended four different high schools, one of which was focused on the arts, before leaving to pursue an acting career. His first professional appearance was in a 1984 episode of the comedy series Hangin’ In.</p>
