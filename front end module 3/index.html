The family moved first to Sydney, then to New York City, and finally to Toronto, where Reeves grew up. He struggled in school and attended four different high schools, one of which was focused on the arts, before leaving to pursue an acting career. His first professional appearance was in a 1984 episode of the comedy series Hangin’ In.</p>

                      Hardy’s childhood and early adulthood gave little indication that he would one day become a movie star.
